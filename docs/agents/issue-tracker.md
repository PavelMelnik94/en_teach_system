# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file
- Comments append under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the referenced path or issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Use `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` as the map and `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md` as child tickets. Track `Type:`, `Status:`, and `Blocked by:` lines; resolve tickets by appending an `## Answer` section and updating the map.
